# Magpies

The goal of this Java program is to detect and isolate Eurasian magpies in a binary image using simple image processing techniques.
The program loads both a test image and a reference image, converts them to binary arrays, detects magpies by matching patterns, and allows saving the cleaned image with only the magpies preserved.
